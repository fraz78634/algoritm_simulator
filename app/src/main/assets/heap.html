<h1>Heap</h1>
<p>A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it&rsquo;s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.</li>
<li><strong>Min-Heap</strong>: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it&rsquo;s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Max Heap Construction Algorithm</h3>
<p>We are going to derive an algorithm for max heap by inserting one element at a time. At any point of time, heap must maintain its property. While insertion, we also assume that we are inserting a node in an already heapified tree.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>
  Step 1 &minus; Create a new node at the end of heap.
Step 2 &minus; Assign new value to the node.
Step 3 &minus; Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
Step 4 &minus; If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
Step 5 &minus; Repeat step 3 &amp; 4 until Heap property holds.
</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>Max Heap Deletion Algorithm</h3>
<p>Let us derive an algorithm to delete from max heap. Deletion in Max (or Min) Heap always happens at the root to remove the Maximum (or minimum) value.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>
Step 1 − Remove root node.
Step 2 − Move the last element of last level to root.
Step 3 − Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
Step 4 − If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
Step 5 − Repeat step 3 & 4 until Heap property holds.
