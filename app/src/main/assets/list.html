<h1>List Data Structure</h1>
<p>A list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.</p>
<h2>Linked List:</h2>
<p>Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Link </strong> - Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.</li>
<li><strong>Next </strong> - Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedList </strong> - A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First. </li>

</ol>
<p>Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.</p>

<li>Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.</li>
<li>Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, in a system, if we maintain a sorted list of numbers in an array num[].</p>
<p>num[] = [10, 20, 50, 200, 300].</p>
<p>And if we want to insert a new ID 15, then to maintain the sorted order, we have to move all the elements after 10 (excluding 10). Deletion is also expensive with arrays until unless some special techniques are used. For example, to delete 20 in num[], everything after 1010 has to be moved.</p>
<h3>Advantages over arrays:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Dynamic size</li>
<li>Ease of insertion/deletion</li>
</ol>
<h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation.</li>
<li>Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.</li>
<li>Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.</li>
</ol>
<p>A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.</p>
<p>Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>data</li>
<li>Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node</li>
</ol>
<p>In C, a node is represented using structures. Below is an example of a linked list node with integer data. In Java or C#, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.</p>
<div>
<pre><code>
  class LinkedList { 
    Node head; // head of the list 
  
    /* Linked list Node*/
    class Node { 
        int data; 
        Node next; 
  
        // Constructor to create a new node 
        // Next is by default initialized 
        // as null 
        Node(int d) { data = d; } 
    } 
}
  </code></pre>
</div>

<div>
<pre><code>
class LinkedList { 
    Node head; // head of list 
  
    /* Linked list Node.  This inner class is made static so that 
       main() can access it */
    static class Node { 
        int data; 
        Node next; 
        Node(int d) 
        { 
            data = d; 
            next = null; 
        } // Constructor 
    } 
  
    /* method to create a simple linked list with 3 nodes*/
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        /* Start with the empty list. */
        LinkedList llist = new LinkedList(); 
  
        llist.head = new Node(1); 
        Node second = new Node(2); 
        Node third = new Node(3); 
  
       
  
          
    } 
}

</div>
<h3>Linked List Traversal:</h3>
<p>In the previous program, we have created a simple linked list with three nodes. Let us traverse the created list and print the data of each node. For traversal, let us write a general-purpose function printList() that prints any given list.</p>
