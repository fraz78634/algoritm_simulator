This project is developed mainly for the teachers and students as well as anyone can use it for learning Data Structure algorithms using an Android app. Our project Algorithm Simulation is source of learning fewer concepts of data structures for students. This app covers the basic concepts of Data structures. Learning using smart phones and tablets just makes sense; it’s a device which is used by almost every student in today’s world. To make the learning more interesting we develop this software which is interactive with teachers and students.
This app will look upon all the needs of students and it will cover all the knowledge areas. Basically, our app is for those students and teachers who are looking for instant information to solve their queries in less time. Hence, we are introducing this app for them. We are using a new language named Kotlin it will provide the support of java and real time performance by using the android studio. This app is time saving for the teachers so that they can teach the student without wasting the time. Algorithm simulator will simulate the algorithms through moving pictures, it means through animation. Working of algorithms through animation is attractive and interesting for its users. So, we took this idea and work on it. It is very interesting and can create a sense of interest in its user. There is just a need of android mobile and anyone can easily use this app.
